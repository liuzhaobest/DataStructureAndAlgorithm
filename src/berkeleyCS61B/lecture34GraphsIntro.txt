Graphs
A set of nodes connected pairwise by edges

directed graphs
undirected graphs

cyclic graph

with edge labels

graph

set of vertices
set of edges
vertices with an edge between are adjacent
vertices or edges may have labels

a path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges
a cycle us a path whose first and las vertices are the same
a graph with a cycle is 'cyclic'

two vertices are connected if there is a path between them

if all vertices are connected, we say graph is connected

(how about directed graph? may seem connected by not?)

some graph processing problems
s-t path
shortest s-t path
cycle
euler tour
hamilton tour
connectivity
biconnectivity
planarity
isomorphism


graph representations

common simplification: integer vertices
Common convention: Number nodes irrespective of label, and use number throughout the graph
implementation.


Representations 1
adjacency matrix

Representations 2
Edge sets: Collection of all edges

representation 3(most popular)
adjacency lists
maintain array of kists indexed by vertex number
