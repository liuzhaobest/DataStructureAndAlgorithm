Compilation

The standard tools for executing Java programs use a two step process
Hello.java -> javac (compiler) -> Hello.class -> java (Interpreter) -> Stuff

why make  a class file at all?
* .class file has been type checked
* .class file are 'simpler' for machine to execute


Object Instantiation



Instance variable

non-static method. If the method is going to be invoked by an instance of the class,
then it should be non-static.
Therefore, it means a static method should only be used when there
is no instance needed.

For example:
Dog.maxDog(maya,yapster).makeNoise(); // it is Dog invoking this method.

Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2];
dogs[0] = new Dog(8);

String[] args
this is an string array you provide when run the class using java
